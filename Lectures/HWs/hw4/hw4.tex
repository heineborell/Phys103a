 \section*{Problem 1 (25 points)}
 A projectile of mass m is launched with an initial velocity $v$; making an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal as shown in figure. The projectile moves in the gravitational field of the Earth. Find the angular momentum of the projectile about the origin (a) when the projectile is at the origin, (b) when it is at the highest point of its trajectory, and (c) just before it hits the ground. (d) What torque causes its angular momentum to change?

%  A bullet of mass $m=8.00\,g$ is fired into a block of mass $M=250\,g$ that is initially at rest at the edge of a table of height $h=1.00\,m$ (figure). The bullet remains in the block, and after the impact the block lands $d=2.00\,m$ from the bottom of the table. Determine the initial speed of the bullet.%9-81

 \section*{Problem 2 (25 points)}
 A solid cube of side $2a$ and mass $M$ is sliding on a frictionless surface with uniform velocity $v$
as shown in figure. It hits a small obstacle at the end of the table that causes the cube to tilt as shown in figure. Find the minimum value of the magnitude of $v$ such that the cube tips over and falls off the table. Note: The cube undergoes an inelastic collision at the edge.

 \section*{Problem 3 (25 points)}
Find the moment of inertia of a flywheel of mass $M$ made by cutting four large holes of radius $r$ out of a uniform disk of radius $R$ (see figure). The holes are centered at a distance $R / 2$ from the center of the flywheel.

\section*{Problem 4 (25 points)}
A uniform solid sphere of radius $r$ is placed on the inside surface of a hemispherical bowl with radius $R$. The sphere is released from rest at an angle $\theta$ to the vertical and rolls without slipping (see fig). Determine the angular speed of the sphere when it reaches the bottom of the bowl.%10-81
