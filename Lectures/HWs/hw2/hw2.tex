\section*{Problem 1}
A small block of mass $m$ rests on the sloping side of a triangular block of mass $M$ which itself rests on a horizontal table as shown in Fig. \ref{fig3}. Assuming all surfaces are frictionless, determine the magnitude of the force $F$ that must be applied to $M$ so that $m$ remains in a fixed position relative to $M$ (that is, $m$ doesn't move on the incline).

\section*{Problem 2}
A particle sliding down a frictionless ramp is to attain a given \textit{horizontal} displacement $\Delta x$ in a minimum amount of time. What is the best angle for the ramp? What is the minimum time (give your answer for time in terms of $\Delta x, g$)?

\section*{Problem 3}
Two blocks of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are sliding down an inclined plane making an angle with the horizontal. The leading block ($m_{2}$) has a coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_{k}$; the trailing block ($m_{1}$) has a coefficient of kinetic friction $2\mu_{k}$. A string connects the two blocks; this string makes an angle $\phi$ with the ramp (Fig. \ref{fig1}). Find the tension in the string.

\section*{Problem 4}
A large mass $M$ hangs (stationary) at the end of a string that passes through a smooth tube to a small mass $m$ that whirls around in a circular path of radius $l\sin\theta$, where $l$ is the length of the string $m$ to the top end of the tube (see Fig. \ref{fig2}). Write down the dynamical equations that apply to each mass and show that $m$ must complete one orbit in a time of $2\pi(lm/gM)^{1/2}$. Consider whether there is any restriction on the value of the angle $\theta$ in this motion.

\section*{Problem 5}
The speed of a body released from rest falling through viscous medium (for instance, an iron pellet falling in a jar full of oil) is given by the formula 
\begin{align}
v=-g\tau+g\tau e^{-t/\tau}
\end{align}
where $\tau$ is a constant that depends on the size and shape of the body and on the viscosity of the medium and $e=2.718\cdots$ is the basis of the natural logarithms.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item Find the acceleration as a function of time.
\item Show that for $t\rightarrow\infty$, the speed approaches terminal value $-g\tau$.
\item By differentiation, verify that the equation for the position as a function of time consistent with the above expression for the speed is 
\begin{align}
x=-g\tau t-g\tau^{2}e^{-t/\tau}+g\tau^{2}+x_{0}
\end{align}
\item Show that for small vales of $t$ ($t\ll\tau$), the equation for $x$ is approximately $x\approx \dfrac{-1}{2}gt^{2}+x_{0}$.
\end{enumerate}
