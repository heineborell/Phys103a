* Objectives

- What does physics do?
  
- Understand units.
  
- What are the fundamental units.
  
- Conversions.
  
- Significant Figures.


* Physics and Experiment
- Like all other sciences, physics is based on experimental observations
and quantitative measurements.

- The main objectives of physics are to identify a limited number of fundamental laws that govern natural phenomena and use them to develop theories that can predict the future experiments.
  
- When there is a discrepancy between the prediction of a theory and experimental results, new or modified theories must be formulated.
  
- For example:
  - Newtonian mechanics $\rightarrow$ Einstein theory of relativity
  - Blackbody radiation $\rightarrow$ Quantum mechanics

* Standards of Length, Mass, Time
- To describe natural phenomena we need measurements.
#+begin_quote
*Base quantities*: Fortunately, they are not all independent; for example, speed is the ratio of a length to a time.
#+end_quot
- In mechanics we have three fundamental quantities: /length, mass/ and /time/.
- In 1960 a committee established set of standards (Kelvin, Ampere, Candela, Mole).

* Oilfield Units (The "Cursed" System)

- A very good video on how chaotic the units in oil-field engineering are:

* Length
- *meter (1960)*: Distance between two lines on a specific platinum-iridium bar in France.

- *meter (1983)*: Distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time of $1/299,792,458$ second.

* Time
- In 1967 second is defined as $9,162,631,770$ times the period of vibration of radiation from the cesium-133 atom.

- A cesium fountain atomic clock. The clock will neither gain nor lose a second in 20 million years.

* Mass
- The SI standard of mass is a cylinder of platinum and iridium kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

* Kibble Balance
- In a Kibble balance, a standard mass can be measured when the downward pull of gravity is balanced by magnetic force.

* Derived Units & Dimensional Analysis
* Dimensional Analysis
- We use brackets $[ ]$ to denote dimensions.
- $\text{speed} \rightarrow [v] = L/T$
- $\text{area} \rightarrow [A] = L^2$

- A dimensional analysis example:

** The G.I. Taylor Bomb Example
- Taylor assumed: $r$ (radius), $\rho$ (density of air), $E$ (energy), $t$ (time).
- The radius is then:
  \[ r(t) = C \rho^{-1/5} E^{1/5} t^{2/5} \]

* Conversion
* Conversion
- We use *chain-link* conversion.

- *Interesting Case*: Fuel efficiency (Litres/100km).
  - Calculated as: 
    \[ \frac{1000 \text{ cm}^3}{100 \text{ km}} = 0.01 \text{ mm}^2 \]

* Significant Figures
** Rules for Significant Figures
- Non-zero digits are significant ($365 \rightarrow 3$).
- Zeros between digits are significant ($6.003 \rightarrow 4$).
- Leading zeros are *not* significant ($0.0075 \rightarrow 2$).
- Trailing decimal zeros are significant ($3.50 \rightarrow 3$).

** Calculation Rules
- *Multiplication/Division*: Smallest number of significant figures.
  \[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi (6.0 \text{ cm})^2 = 1.1 \times 10^2 \text{ cm}^2 \]
- *Addition/Subtraction*: Smallest number of decimal places.
  - Example: $23.2 + 5.174 = 28.4$
