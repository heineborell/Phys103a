# Chapter 8 -- Conservation of Energy

## Conservation of mechanical energy

- If the only force acting on the particle is gravity we can obtain a relation between potential energy and kinetic energy.

<!--pause-->

- Remember the change of kinetic energy equals the net work done on the particle; that is

```latex +render +width:40%
$W = \Delta K = K_2 -K_1 = \frac{1}{2}(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2})$
```

- And since the particle is only under the influence of gravitational force, the work done by gravitational force is minus of the gravitational energy U.

```latex +render +width:60%
$W = - \Delta U = -(U_2-U_1),\quad where \,\, U(x)=-\int_{x_0}^{x}F_x(x')dx'$
```

<!--pause-->

- Equating the work done in we find

```latex +render +width:20%
$ K_{2}+U_{2}=K_{1}+U_{1}$
```

- The sum of the kinetic and potential energies is called the _mechanical energy_ of the
  particle. It is usually designated by the symbol E:

```latex +render +width:40%
$ E=K+U =\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}+mgy = constant$
```
