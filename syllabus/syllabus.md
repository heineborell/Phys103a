## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of electromagnetism in an accessible and intuitive manner. Topics include electric forces and fields, electric potential, electric current, resistance, and basic electrical circuits. Students will explore magnetic fields, magnetic forces, and electromagnetic induction, with emphasis on practical applications. The course concludes with an introduction to electromagnetic waves, highlighting their properties, behavior, and role in the transmission of energy.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Apply vector analysis techniques to problems in electromagnetism

- Explain key principles of electrostatic and magnetostatic fields

- Demonstrate problem-solving skills in various electromagnetic contexts

- Build a strong foundation for further study and practical applications in electromagnetic theory and engineering

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to demonstrate academic honesty in all aspects of this course. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: violating clearly stated rules for taking an exam or completing an assignment; plagiarism (including material from sources without a citation and quotation marks around any borrowed words); claiming another’s work or a modification of another’s work as one’s own; buying or attempting to buy papers or projects for a course; fabricating information or citations.

## Course Policies

Attendance is mandatory and will be formally graded. Assignments and exams must be submitted on time. Late submissions will result in point deductions that may affect your final grade. If you anticipate a conflict with a due date or encounter difficulties with an assignment, you must plan ahead and notify the instructor in advance. This will allow us to discuss the situation and, if appropriate, make alternative arrangements.
